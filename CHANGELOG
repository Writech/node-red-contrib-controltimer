## v0.4.1 (27.05.2023)
    * Bugfix: When the timer was in a paused state and received an override configuration, it failed to update the visible timer progress.

## v0.4.0 (27.05.2023)
    * Rename `isConsecutiveStartActionTimerResetAllowed` configuration option to `resetTimerOnReceivalOfStartAction` for more consistent naming convention.
    * Add new configuration option `continueTimerOnReceivalOfStartAction` to control whether `START` action should continue a paused timer.
    * Move `resetTimerOnReceivalOfStartAction` option (previously `isConsecutiveStartActionTimerResetAllowed`) next to `continueTimerOnReceivalOfStartAction` option everywhere (in code an in UI).
    * Continue paused timer on receival of `START` action if `continueTimerOnReceivalOfStartAction` option is enabled.

## v0.3.0 (17.11.2022)
    * Allow overriding `timerType`, `timerDuration`, and `timerDurationUnit` via `START` action.
